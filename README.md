## Design and implement a React + Redux application that resembles the Reviews section of an Amazon Products page
Please implement a list of reviews. See attached mockup for reference. Users should be able to filter, group, order and search for reviews.

## Functional Requirements:
 - Reviews can be grouped by day, week, or month. Make sure you show the time interval for which reviews are shown (i.e. “05.02”, “05.02 - 11.02” or “January”)
 - Reviews can be filtered by number of stars. The default state should show 5 star reviews only.
 - Reviews should be sortable by time. Users should be able to toggle between showing most recent reviews first, or last.
 - Infinite scrolling. As you scroll, more reviews will be loaded.
## Non-functional Requirements:
 - React and Redux implementation. You are free to use any Redux middlewares you prefer
 - Basic unit test coverage. We don’t want to see 100% test coverage, but we do want you to showcase your approach to testing
 - Clean UI. Our applications require strong usability and we are looking for people with an eye for good UX. Show us what you can do.You may use any boilerplate you want to quickly bootstrap the application. Bonus points for using styled components.

## Reviews section of an Amazon Products page


**Functional Requirements**
 - Reviews can be grouped by day, week, or month. Make sure you show the time interval for which reviews are shown (i.e. “05.02”, “05.02 - 11.02” or “January”)
 - Reviews can be filtered by number of stars. The default state should show 5 star reviews only.
 - Reviews should be sortable by time. Users should be able to toggle between showing most recent reviews first, or last.
 - Infinite scrolling. As you scroll, more reviews will be loaded.
